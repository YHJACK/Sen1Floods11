Bonafilia, D., Tellman, B., Anderson, T., Issenberg, E. 2020. Sen1Floods11: a georeferenced dataset to train and test deep learning flood algorithms for Sentinel-1. 2020 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), EarthVision Workshop.

## Dataset Access
The dataset is available for download at: gs://cnn_chips/

You can download the dataset to the folder that notebooks expect it to be in by running

`$ mkdir /home/files3`

`$ gsutil -m rsync gs://cnn_chips /home/files3`

## Event Metadata
Locations of the flood events and metadata is contained in *Sen1Floods11_Metadata.geojson*. The following fields can be found:

| Field | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ID | Unique ID for each event |
| location | Flood event location (country) |
| ISO_CC | ISO Country Code for flood event location |
| s1_date | Date (YYYY-MM-dd) that Sentinel-1 image was acquired |
| s2_date | Date (YYYY-MM-dd) that Sentinel-2 image was acquired
| orbit| Orbit (ASCENDING or DESCENDING) that Sentinel-1 image was acquired |
| rel_orbit_num | Relative Orbit Number that Sentinel-1 image was acquired |
| coincident_size | Number of coincident tiles from S2 |
| VH_thresh | Threshold used for Sentinel-1 VH band to classify water in reference S1 classification |
| train_chip | Number of chips used for training |
| val_chip | Number of chips used for validation |

## Example Use
Main_Training_Stuff.ipynb runs shows how to go through the training loop with the dataset.
Test_Models.ipynb runs shows how to go evaluate a model on the test sets.
