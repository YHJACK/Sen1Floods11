# Sen1Floods11

**NOTE: As of v1.1 of Sen1Floods11 the data has been moved to the `sen1floods11` bucket on GCS. The original v1.0 data is still hosted for now on the original `cnn_chips` bucket. v1.1 involved major restructing of the bucket and more understandable file naming as well as updates to the dataset and data format to comply with COG spec.**

## Dataset Access

The dataset is available for access through Google Cloud Storage bucket at: `gs://senfloods11/`

You can access the dataset bucket using the [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) command line tool. If you would like to download the entire dataset (~14 GB) you can use `gsutil rsync` to clone the bucket to a local directory. The `-m` flag is recommended to speed downloads. The `-r` flag will download sub-directories and folder recursively. See the example below.

```bash
$ gsutil -m rsync -r gs://sen1floods11 /YOUR/LOCAL/DIRECTORY/HERE
```

If using an example notebook, you can download the dataset to the folder that notebooks expect it to be in by running

```bash
$ mkdir /home/files
$ gsutil -m rsync -r gs://sen1floods11 /home/files
```

## Bucket Structure

The `sen1floods11` bucket is split into subfolders containing data, checkpoints, training/testing splits, and a [STAC](https://stacspec.org/) compliant catalog. More detail on each is provided in the docs README.

## Dataset Information

Each file follows the naming scheme EVENT_CHIPID_LAYER.tif (e.g. `Bolivia_103757_S2Hand.tif`). Chip IDs are unique, and not shared between events. Events are named by country and further information on each event (including dates) can be found in the event metadata below. Each layer has a separate GeoTIFF, and can contain multiple bands in a stacked GeoTIFF. All images are projected to WGS 84 (`EPSG:4326`) at 10 m ground resolution.

| Layer | Description                                                                                                                                              | Values                                                  | Format                                           | Bands                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
